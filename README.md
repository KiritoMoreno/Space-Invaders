# Space Invaders Replica

## Game Description

Space Invaders Replica is a game where the player must eliminate the invaders before they reach the bottom of the screen. During the game, the player must dodge and hide behind the "torchkas" to avoid being hit by enemy shots. In addition to the swarm of invaders, an UFO will occasionally appear, but the main focus will be on the swarm.

## Key Features

In this project, we will replicate the main features of the Space Invaders game using Unity. Throughout the development, you will learn how to:

- Generate and move the swarm of invaders.
- Make the invaders at the head of the swarm shoot laser bullets.
- Move and shoot as a player.
- Change the tempo of the music and the speed of the swarm based on the kill count.
